# Arpit Bala Image Required

## File: arpit.png

**Location:** `hack_vs/backend/assets/arpit.png`

**Description:** 
- This should be a PNG image of Arpit Bala (Indian comedian and content creator)
- Similar style and quality as the other speaker images (elon.png, trump.png, samay.png, baburao.png)
- Recommended size: Similar dimensions to other speaker images (around 200-300px width)
- Format: PNG with transparent background preferred
- Style: Professional headshot or character image that matches the comedy theme

**Current Status:** âœ… AVAILABLE - File has been updated with correct image (images-removebg-preview.png)

**Impact:** Without this image, the video generation will fail when using the "samay_arpit" speaker pair.

**Action Required:** 
1. âœ… Image file has been updated with correct `arpit.png`
2. âœ… File is in PNG format and ready to use
3. âœ… System is ready for testing with the new speaker pair
4. ðŸ§ª Test the "samay_arpit" speaker pair functionality

**Note:** The system has been fully configured to support Arpit Bala as a speaker, but this image file is required for the video generation to work properly.
