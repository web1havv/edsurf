So, class, what's the big deal about a blockchain server?  It's not just some fancy server, you know.

It's like, a digital ledger, but everyone has a copy, right?  So, it's super secure.  Like, totally unhackable!  Believe me.

Wrong, Donald.  It's decentralized,  meaning copies are spread across many servers.  Think of it like having a secret recipe, not just one copy in one kitchen, but a hundred.  If someone tries to change one copy...

They'd have to change them ALL!  Huge!  Like, the biggest, most beautiful, unhackable ledger ever made.  So, it's better than my tax returns, right?

Exactly, but also incredibly complex to maintain.  A full node has the whole history, like a giant library.  A light node just has the headings.

So a light node is like...a small library, with just the titles?  Sounds fake news to me.  Very sad.  But bigly efficient, right?  The best efficiency!
