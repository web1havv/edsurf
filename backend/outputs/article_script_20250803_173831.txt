So, class, what's the key advantage of Redis over, say, MySQL for caching?

It's, like, HUGE, right?  Much faster.  Think of it like… my buildings versus…  those… other buildings.  Much bigger, much better.  Believe me.

Redis uses in-memory storage, Donald.  It's like having your favorite cheeseburger always on your desk instead of ordering it from a slow restaurant every time.  Faster, more efficient. You wouldn't want to wait all day for a cheeseburger, would you?

No way!  I want my cheeseburger NOW!  And it should be… BIGLY!  The best cheeseburger!

Exactly!  And that's why Redis is so fast. It's all about speed.  It’s in-memory.  Like… having the internet on your phone instead of dial-up.  Remember dial-up, Donald?  Those were dark times.  You might have used it. 

Dark times indeed… but they made me who I am today.  So, this… Redis… thing… it’s single-threaded, right? Sounds kinda… weak.

Not weak, Donald.  Efficient. Imagine a chef perfectly preparing one dish at a time versus a chaotic kitchen. Single-threaded avoids contention, making it super fast for data retrieval.  It’s like…  my rallies, perfectly crafted speeches, one after another!

It's like my hair. Perfectly crafted, always. The best hair. Everyone agrees.
