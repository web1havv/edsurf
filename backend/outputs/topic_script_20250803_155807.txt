==================================================

So, class, what's the big deal about quantum mechanics?  It's, like, totally mind-bending.

It's HUGE, Elon, really HUGE.  Like, bigger than my rallies, believe me.  So, it's about…tiny things, right?

Exactly.  Think of it like this:  a golf ball is classical physics – you know exactly where it is.  But an electron? It's like that golf ball's bouncing around in a giant, blurry cloud of probability.  You can only guess where it might be.

Fake news!  It's either here or there, Elon.  Very simple.  Make America Great Again, and we'll have the best electrons.

No, Donald, it's both at the same time until we measure it.  It's…superposition.  Like Schrödinger's cat—it's both dead and alive until you open the box!

Schrödinger? Sounds like a loser, Elon.  My cats are always great, the best cats.  But this "entanglement" thing…that’s where things get really crazy, right?  It's like, super-speed communication!
