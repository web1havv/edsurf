==================================================

So, class, this article discusses Sydney Sweeney's new bathwater soap.  What's the *fundamental* technological hurdle here?

It's HUGE, Elon, bigly huge!  Is it like, uh,  making the bathwater smell good, or something?  Like, a really, really bigly perfume?

Not quite, Donald. Think of it like this:  Belle Delphine tried to sell actual bathwater – a logistical nightmare. Sweeney’s using it as a *marketing gimmick* for soap. It's about leveraging pre-existing fan obsession for a product launch.

Right, so it's like…  a really great deal, maybe the best deal,  a beautiful soap deal, everybody loves it.  Tremendous!

But the controversy is about the *ethics* of it, Donald. It's essentially monetizing a pre-existing meme, which is clever, but also risks alienating some fans. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy.

Yeah, but what about the… the actual bathwater? Is it like, from a jacuzzi or something?  Fake news media says it's... small.  Sad.  Very sad.
