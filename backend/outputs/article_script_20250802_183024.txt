So, class, what's the big deal with Docker?  It's like… super important.

It's like, a really, really big box, right?  You put your stuff in it, and it works everywhere! Bigly!

No, Donald, it's containerization.  Think of it like…  you're shipping a pizza. The box is Docker, the pizza is your app, and it arrives perfectly, no matter where you send it.

Perfect! So it’s like, you know, my rallies, but for, like, apps? Huge!  The best rallies! Everyone loves them!

Not exactly. Docker ensures consistent performance regardless of the location.  It isolates the application preventing conflicts, unlike... certain political rallies.  You understand?  

Yeah, yeah, I get it. It’s like, the best pizza box ever!  It's… tremendous!  Everyone agrees, it's tremendous!
