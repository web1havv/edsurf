So this article says Docker and Kubernetes are, like, totally revolutionizing things.  Huge.

Yeah, well, I knew that.  It's very bigly. Everyone knows it. Tremendous.  My administration… well, maybe we could’ve done more.  But it’s happening now, and that’s fantastic.


Right, but the article points out how it’s boosting efficiency and cutting costs.  That’s the real game-changer, right?  It’s all about optimization.  Think of the potential for… you know…  Mars colonization.

Optimization?  I’m all about optimization.  Believe me. We optimized the economy, best economy ever.  This Docker thing sounds…  pretty good, I guess.  It’s something.  But my buildings are much more impressive. Way bigger.


The article talks about microservices architecture, too.  That’s a big deal for scaling applications.  Imagine the possibilities.  It’s crazy disruptive.

Disruptive, you say?  Fake news!  I’m the most disruptive guy ever.  I’ve disrupted the political system, the media, the whole damn thing. Nobody’s ever disrupted anything quite like me. This Docker thing is nothing.


But seriously, the projected market growth is insane.  We’re talking massive expansion.  This is a huge opportunity for…  well, for a lot of people.

Massive, you say?  I build massive things.  The best buildings.  The biggest crowds.  And, frankly, this… this Docker sounds like a small, insignificant thing compared to my accomplishments.  SAD!


It's not a building, it's a software platform, but the potential is definitely massive for innovation.  Think of all the new apps, new tech…

Yeah, well,  we’ll see.  We’ll see.  It’s all very… interesting.  But you know what’s really interesting?  Winning.  And I win a lot.  Everyone agrees.  The best.
