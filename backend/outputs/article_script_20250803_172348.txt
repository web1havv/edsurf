So, class, GIFT City… anyone understand this whole USD trading thing in India?

It’s HUGE, like, really, really bigly!  So, you're saying,  Indians can now buy American stocks, right?  Easy peasy!

Not exactly.  GIFT City lets NRIs trade Indian stocks in USD, avoiding currency risk. Think of it like buying apples in dollars at a special store – no rupees needed.

So, it's like a… a really, really big beautiful apple store?  With no taxes?  Tremendous!

Almost. There's no Securities Transaction Tax, no stamp duty…  but it's a *separate* account, not your regular Indian one. It’s a whole different regulatory system, overseen by the IFSCA, not SEBI.

Sounds complicated.  But… low taxes?  I like low taxes.  Best deal ever.  Believe me.
