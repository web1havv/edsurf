So, class, this article on fluid dynamics… what's the core concept?  It's all about how stuff flows, right?

Yeah, flowing! Bigly flowing!  Like, the best flowing you've ever seen!  It's huge, it's tremendous. What about the, uh,  pipes?

It's not just about pipes, Donald.  Think of it like this: water going down a hill. Gravity pulls it, pressure pushes it. Simple, right?  It's the same with air, gases—even blood in your arteries. It's all about energy and pressure differences.

So it's like, a big, beautiful flow of…  energy?  The best energy, folks, the best. Believe me.  So, like, my new golf course water system?  Total fluid dynamics mastery.

Not exactly. It’s more nuanced than that. The article also discusses laminar vs. turbulent flow. Think of a smooth, steady stream from a tap versus a chaotic waterfall.  It’s about  predictability of the flow.

Yeah,  predictable like my… uh, my election win!  Totally predictable!  It was, you know…  the best flowing situation, everybody agreed.  Fake news!  So the turbulent flow is bad? SAD!
