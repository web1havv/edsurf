So, class, what's a vector database, in the simplest terms you can muster?

It's like… a super-duper smart filing cabinet, right?  It holds all the… you know… the really important stuff. Bigly important.

Not exactly.  It stores information as vectors, not files.  Think of it like this: each file is a point on a map.  Similar files are close together.  The database finds similar files quickly.

So it's like… finding the closest McDonald's to my golf course?  You know, the best, the most tremendous McDonald's?

It's more like finding the most similar documents to a query based on their meaning, not just keywords. It uses advanced math to determine similarity, not just location.

Yeah, but… can it handle… fake news?  Because, you know, the media is fake.  Totally fake.  Believe me.
