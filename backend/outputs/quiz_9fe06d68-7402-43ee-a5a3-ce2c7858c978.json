  "questions": [
    {
      "question_id": 1,
      "question": "What is the primary innovation of the Transformer model?",
      "options": [
        "Using convolutional neural networks for sequence transduction",
        "Employing recurrent neural networks for enhanced parallelization",
        "Relying solely on attention mechanisms for sequence transduction",
        "Combining recurrent and convolutional networks with attention mechanisms"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "The Transformer replaces recurrent and convolutional layers with an attention mechanism."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 2,
      "question": "Why is the Transformer more parallelizable than recurrent models?",
      "options": [
        "It uses convolutional layers which are inherently parallelizable",
        "Recurrent models cannot process sequences in parallel, while the Transformer can",
        "The Transformer uses multiple GPUs, while recurrent models use a single GPU",
        "It employs a feed-forward network that can be parallelized efficiently"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Recurrent models process sequentially; the Transformer's attention mechanism allows parallel processing."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 3,
      "question": "In what ways does the Transformer utilize multi-head attention?",
      "options": [
        "Only in the decoder for autoregressive generation",
        "In encoder-decoder attention, encoder self-attention, and decoder self-attention",
        "Exclusively in encoder self-attention for input representation",
        "Primarily in the feed-forward network for improved efficiency"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 1,
      "explanation": "Multi-head attention is used in three ways: encoder-decoder attention, encoder self-attention, and decoder self-attention."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 4,
      "question": "How does the Transformer handle the sequential nature of language, given its lack of recurrence?",
      "options": [
        "By using a modified recurrent network in parallel with the attention mechanism",
        "It inherently captures sequence information through the attention mechanism itself",
        "Through the addition of positional encodings to the input embeddings",
        "By using a convolutional layer to capture local dependencies in the sequence"
      ],
      "correct_answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Positional encodings are added to input embeddings to provide information about word order."
    },
    {
      "question_id": 5,
      "question": "Based on the results, what is a significant advantage of the Transformer model for machine translation?",
      "options": [
        "It requires less training data compared to other models",
        "It achieves higher BLEU scores with significantly less training time and cost",
        "It is simpler to implement than existing models",
        "It uses fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art models"
      ],
