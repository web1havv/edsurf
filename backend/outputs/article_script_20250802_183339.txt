So, class, what's a Docker container, huh?  Think of it like… a really fancy, self-contained apartment.

It's like, a tiny apartment building, right?  You can put anything in it,  huge success, the best apartment!

No, Donald, it's more like…  your code lives in this self-contained unit. It has everything it needs –  the plumbing, the electricity, everything.  It runs independently of the building, which is your operating system.

So, like,  it’s totally secure,  nobody can touch it, right?  Like my wall around the White House,  the best wall!

It's secure, yes, but think of it more like… a perfectly isolated ecosystem, like a terrarium.  It contains everything to operate independent of any outside factors.

Beautiful, beautiful.  So it’s like,  a really, really bigly successful terrarium,  the best terrarium, everybody agrees.
