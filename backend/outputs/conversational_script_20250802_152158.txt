So this article says Docker and Kubernetes are… huge.  Revolutionizing everything, apparently.

Yeah, well, my hotels are HUGE, the biggest, the best.  Nobody does hotels bigger than me.  These… Dockers and Kubern… whatever,  they're probably fake news.  Sad.

Fake news?  These things are literally powering the internet, Donald.  SpaceX uses them.  It's not fake news, it's…  technology.  Real, actual rocket science stuff.


Rocket science, you say?  I know about rockets, believe me.  I've seen bigger, better, more beautiful rockets than whatever those things are.  They're probably made in China.  Total losers.

China?  They're open source, actually.  Anyone can use them.  It's the opposite of your, uh…  "America First" approach.

America First is the BEST approach.  The greatest.  And speaking of great, my rallies were bigger than any launch you ever had.  Bigger crowds, I tell you.  HUGE.

Well, my rockets actually go to space, unlike your… uh… promises.  So I'm pretty sure my crowds are a little more… scientifically proven.

See, this is why I won.  You're all about your rockets and your…  what do you call those things?  Electric cars?  People want something REAL. They want results.  Bigly results.  And I delivered those.  Believe me.
