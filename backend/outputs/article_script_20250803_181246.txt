So, Figma, huh?  Biggest VC-backed IPO in years.  Explain this to me like I'm… well, you know.

It's like, you build a really great Lego castle, right?  Then, instead of just keeping it, you sell shares of the castle to investors.  Huge success.  So, how much money did they make, like, a billion? A trillion?

More than a billion, actually.  It's software, not Legos. It's design software, used by, like, everyone to make websites and apps.  Think of it as the ultimate digital construction set.

That's great.  Tremendous.  So, it's like,  you know,  my buildings, only… digital.  Better, actually.  Much bigger, maybe.  The best digital buildings, everybody agrees.

Right. Except they’re not *your* buildings.  And they’re not physical.  The value is in the software itself, not any bricks and mortar.

Yeah, yeah, software…  digital…  whatever.  Sounds… tremendous.  So,  it's a big deal.  Huge.  The best deal.  Everyone agrees.
