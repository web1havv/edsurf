So, class, what's the core difference between speaker identification and diarization, according to this article?

It's, like, HUGE! One is, like, identifying the big, beautiful person speaking, right?  The other is…  the other is…  something else, right?

Exactly.  Speaker identification is like recognizing your face—you need a database of known faces. Diarization is just knowing who's talking *when*, even without knowing their names. Think of it like separating instruments in a song—you know there's a guitar, a bass, and drums, but you don't need to know the *names* of the players.  It’s simple.

So, it's like, you know, identifying who's talking and, like, putting them in their place, right?  Bigly.

Precisely! But the article also says Encord’s tools help with overlapping speech—that's, like, really important, you know?  Like, in my rallies, people often talk over each other… it’s very exciting.  It's a beautiful thing.

Yes, very beautiful.  Overlapping speech is a challenge, as the article highlights, because it makes analysis much more complex.  But tools like Encord are making it easier to sort that out.  You know, like sorting out… uh… fake news?  It’s very similar.  Very similar.
